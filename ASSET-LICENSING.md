- Vector assets: All `.svg` files under `satellites/` are original works created by the maintainers and are licensed under CC BY 4.0, the same as other original materials in this repository.
- Raster assets: All `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg` files under `satellites/` were sourced from third‑party websites and resized for reference. They are not licensed here and remain under their original terms. Any reuse must comply with the original rights holder’s terms or applicable law.
- See `ATTRIBUTIONS.csv` for per‑file provenance (source URL, rights holder, stated license/terms). Where an `.svg` is original, the rights holder can be listed as the repository maintainers and the license as CC BY 4.0.

If you are a rights holder and want an asset removed or corrected, please open an issue or contact the maintainer.
